<p>Welcome to Sweet Home Desserts, your little nook of indulgence in the heart of Marikina. Sweet Home Desserts was born out of love for home-style baking and the forward-thinking dream of spreading happiness, one gourmet dessert at a time. We have been serving joy since 2011.<br><br><br>


From leche flan to a shortcake, each of our treats is infused with love, butter, and a sprinkle of nostalgia. Our kitchen may be small, but our passion is anything but — we dream that desserts shouldn't just taste good, they should feel like warm hugs from home.<br><br><br>


Every bite at Sweet Home Desserts tells a story, each one coming from Sunday afternoons, handwritten recipes, and a community bound together by sugar and smiles.<br><br><br>


Please drop by and greet us, but better yet, stay for cake. You are always, always welcome here. 💕</p>
