<h3>About Us! ₊˚⊹♡</h3>
<p>Welcome to <font face="Georgia"><i>Whisk & Whimsy</i></font>, your little nook of indulgence in the heart of <i>Marikina</i>. Sweet Home Desserts was born out of love for home-style baking and the forward-thinking dream of spreading happiness, one gourmet dessert at a time.<strong><i>We have been serving joy since 2011.</i></strong> <br><br><br>


From leche flan to a shortcake, each of our treats is infused with love, butter, and a sprinkle of nostalgia. Our kitchen may be small, but our passion is anything but — <i>we dream that desserts shouldn't just taste good, they should feel like warm hugs from home.</i><br><br><br>


<i>Every bite at Sweet Home Desserts tells a story</i>, each one coming from Sunday afternoons, handwritten recipes, and a community bound together by sugar and smiles.<br><br><br>


<font face="Georgia"><i><strong>Please drop by and greet us, but better yet, stay for cake. You are always, always welcome here. 💕</strong></i></font></p><br><br><br><p>This is inspired by my old webpage activity.</p>
